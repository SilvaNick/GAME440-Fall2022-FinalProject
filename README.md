This is the code used for our final project. 


440Final_Wifi is the code that is put on the Arduinos worn on the vests we made.

MasterClient is the code put on the Arduino connected to the game master's PC in order to read the Serial Monitor.

OtherClients_Stations is the code used on the two stations.
